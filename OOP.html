<h3>Unit 5: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h3>

<h4>1. What is OOP? List the characteristics of OOP.</h4>

<p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. It focuses on creating reusable software components that interact with each other. Unlike traditional procedural programming, which emphasizes a sequence of steps, OOP models real-world entities as objects, each having attributes (data) and behaviors (methods). This approach promotes modularity, flexibility, and maintainability in software development. The core idea is to encapsulate data and the functions that operate on that data into a single unit, an object, thereby protecting data from unintended external modification.</p>

<p>The key characteristics of OOP, often referred to as pillars, are:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> This is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. It also restricts direct access to some of an object's components, meaning that the internal representation of an object is hidden from the outside view. This is achieved through access specifiers like public, private, and protected. Encapsulation helps in maintaining data integrity and reducing complexity by creating a "black box" where users only need to know how to interact with the object's interface, not its internal workings.</li>
    <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (subclass or derived class) can inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from an existing class (superclass or base class). This promotes code reusability as common functionalities can be defined once in a base class and then extended by multiple derived classes. It establishes an "is-a" relationship between classes, allowing for the creation of a hierarchical classification of objects. For example, a "Car" class can inherit from a "Vehicle" class, inheriting general vehicle properties.</li>
    <li><strong>Polymorphism:</strong> Meaning "many forms," polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms. There are two main types:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading):</strong> Where multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters.</li>
            <li><strong>Run-time Polymorphism (Method Overriding):</strong> Where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. Polymorphism enhances flexibility and extensibility, allowing for more generic and adaptable code.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It focuses on "what" an object does rather than "how" it does it. This is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces, which define a contract for what an object should do without specifying the exact implementation. Abstraction simplifies the design and understanding of complex systems by allowing developers to focus on the higher-level concepts without getting bogged down in the minutiae.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Explain terms polymorphism and inheritance.</h4>

<h5>Polymorphism:</h5>
<p>Polymorphism, derived from Greek words "poly" (many) and "morph" (form), literally means "many forms." In OOP, it refers to the ability of an object to take on many forms or, more specifically, the ability of a method to behave differently depending on the object that invokes it. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type, enabling a single interface to represent various underlying data types or behaviors. This concept is crucial for designing flexible and extensible systems, as it allows for generic operations that can apply to different objects.</p>

<p>There are two primary types of polymorphism in OOP:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism):</strong> This is achieved through method overloading or operator overloading.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Method Overloading:</strong> Allows multiple methods within the same class to share the same name but differ in the number, type, or order of their parameters. The compiler determines which method to call at compile time based on the arguments provided.</li>
            <li><strong>Operator Overloading:</strong> (Applicable in some languages like C++) allows operators (e.g., +, -, *) to be redefined for user-defined data types.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Run-time Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism):</strong> This is typically achieved through method overriding.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Method Overriding:</strong> Occurs when a subclass provides its own specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. The decision of which method to call is made at runtime based on the actual type of the object, not the reference type. This is often facilitated by virtual functions in languages like C++ or simply through method definitions in Java.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h5>Inheritance:</h5>
<p>Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows a new class (called the <strong>subclass</strong>, <strong>derived class</strong>, or <strong>child class</strong>) to acquire the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of an existing class (called the <strong>superclass</strong>, <strong>base class</strong>, or <strong>parent class</strong>). The primary purpose of inheritance is to promote code reusability, reduce redundancy, and establish a hierarchical relationship between classes. It models the "is-a" relationship; for example, a "Dog" is a "Mammal," and a "Car" is a "Vehicle."</p>

<p>Key aspects of inheritance:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Code Reusability:</strong> Features defined in the superclass do not need to be rewritten in the subclass, saving development time and effort.</li>
    <li><strong>Hierarchical Classification:</strong> Inheritance allows for the creation of a clear and logical hierarchy of classes, reflecting real-world relationships.</li>
    <li><strong>Extensibility:</strong> New functionalities can be added to the derived classes without modifying the base class.</li>
    <li><strong>Method Overriding:</strong> While inheriting methods, a subclass can also provide its own specialized implementation for an inherited method (as discussed in polymorphism), which allows for specific behaviors within the general framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>Different types of inheritance exist depending on the language (e.g., single inheritance, multiple inheritance, multilevel inheritance, hierarchical inheritance, hybrid inheritance), but the core principle remains the same: passing down characteristics from parent to child classes.</p>

<h4>3. What is OOP? List the advantages of OOP.</h4>

<p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a powerful programming paradigm that structures software around objects rather than functions and logic. An object is an instance of a class, representing a real-world entity with its own data (attributes) and the procedures (methods) that operate on that data. The core principle of OOP is to encapsulate data and the methods that operate on it into a single unit, promoting modularity and maintainability. This approach models complex systems as collections of interacting objects, making the development process more intuitive and reflective of real-world scenarios. It stands in contrast to procedural programming, which focuses on a sequence of instructions to manipulate data.</p>

<p>The advantages of using OOP are significant and have led to its widespread adoption in modern software development:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Modularity and Reusability:</strong> OOP promotes the creation of self-contained modules (objects) that can be easily reused in different parts of an application or even in different projects. This significantly reduces development time and effort, as developers don't have to rewrite code for common functionalities. Classes can be designed once and then instantiated multiple times.</li>
    <li><strong>Improved Maintainability:</strong> Due to encapsulation, changes within one part of an object (e.g., its internal data structure) do not necessarily affect other parts of the system, as long as the object's public interface remains consistent. This makes debugging easier and reduces the risk of introducing new bugs when modifications are made.</li>
    <li><strong>Enhanced Security (Data Hiding):</strong> Encapsulation allows for data hiding (achieved through access specifiers like <code>private</code> or <code>protected</code>), which prevents direct external access to an object's internal state. Data can only be accessed or modified through the object's defined methods, protecting it from accidental or unauthorized manipulation. This increases the robustness and integrity of the system.</li>
    <li><strong>Better Code Organization and Structure:</strong> OOP provides a clear, logical structure to programs. By organizing code into classes and objects, complex systems become more manageable and easier to understand. This improves teamwork, as different developers can work on separate objects concurrently.</li>
    <li><strong>Scalability and Extensibility:</strong> OOP makes it easier to extend functionality without altering existing code. Through inheritance and polymorphism, new classes can be added or existing ones can be modified to incorporate new features or adapt to changing requirements, without disrupting the entire system. This makes OOP ideal for large and evolving projects.</li>
    <li><strong>Reduced Development Time:</strong> The benefits of reusability and modularity directly translate to faster development cycles. Developers can leverage existing components and focus on implementing new, specific features.</li>
    <li><strong>Easier Debugging:</strong> Because objects are self-contained and interact through well-defined interfaces, isolating and fixing errors becomes less complex. Issues are often contained within specific objects rather than spreading across the entire codebase.</li>
    <li><strong>Real-World Modeling:</strong> OOP's emphasis on objects naturally aligns with how humans perceive and interact with the real world. This makes it easier to design and implement solutions that closely mimic real-world scenarios, leading to more intuitive and understandable software.</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Why C++ is Called an Object-Oriented Programming Language</h4>
    <p>C++ is called an object-oriented programming (OOP) language because it supports and implements the core principles of the object-oriented paradigm. These principles allow programmers to model real-world entities as software objects, leading to more modular, reusable, and maintainable code. Here's a breakdown of why C++ fits this description:</p>

    <h4>Objects and Classes</h4>
    <p>At the heart of OOP are objects, which are instances of classes. A <strong>class</strong> is a blueprint or a template that defines the properties (data members) and behaviors (member functions) that an object will have. An <strong>object</strong> is a concrete realization of that class, containing actual data. C++ provides robust mechanisms for defining classes and creating objects from them.</p>

    <h4>Encapsulation</h4>
    <p>This principle involves bundling data and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit (the class), and restricting direct access to some of the object's components. C++ enforces encapsulation through access specifiers like <code>public</code>, <code>private</code>, and <code>protected</code>. This protects data from external, unauthorized modification and ensures data integrity.</p>

    <h4>Inheritance</h4>
    <p>Inheritance allows a new class (derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (base class). This promotes code reusability and establishes an "is-a" relationship between classes. C++ supports various forms of inheritance, including single, multiple, hierarchical, and multilevel inheritance, enabling the creation of complex class hierarchies.</p>

    <h4>Polymorphism</h4>
    <p>Meaning "many forms," polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type. C++ supports polymorphism primarily through:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Function Overloading:</strong> Allowing multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.</li>
        <li><strong>Operator Overloading:</strong> Allowing operators to have different meanings based on the context.</li>
        <li><strong>Virtual Functions:</strong> Enabling runtime polymorphism, where the correct function to be called is determined at runtime based on the actual object type, rather than the reference type. This is crucial for achieving dynamic dispatch.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Abstraction</h4>
    <p>Abstraction focuses on showing only essential information and hiding the complex implementation details. C++ facilitates abstraction through abstract classes and interfaces (achieved through pure virtual functions). Programmers can define abstract base classes that specify a common interface, and concrete derived classes then provide the specific implementations.</p>

    <p>By effectively implementing these core OOP concepts, C++ empowers developers to design and build software systems that are more organized, scalable, and easier to manage, particularly for large and complex projects. This is why it is consistently classified as an object-oriented programming language.</p>

<h4>5. What is procedural oriented programming? Explain.</h4>

<p>Procedural Oriented Programming (POP), often simply called procedural programming, is a programming paradigm that organizes programs as a sequence of instructions or commands. It is centered around the concept of procedures or functions (also known as routines, subroutines, or methods), which are blocks of code designed to perform a specific task. In POP, the emphasis is on the logic and the sequence of steps required to complete a computation, with data being manipulated by these procedures.</p>

<p>Key characteristics and explanation of POP:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Emphasis on Procedures:</strong> The primary building block in POP is the procedure or function. Programs are designed by breaking down a larger task into smaller, manageable procedures. Each procedure performs a specific operation on data.</li>
    <li><strong>Top-Down Approach:</strong> POP typically follows a top-down design approach. The main program logic is defined first, and then it is broken down into smaller, more specific functions. These functions, in turn, might call other sub-functions, creating a hierarchy of procedures.</li>
    <li><strong>Global Data:</strong> In procedural programming, data is often separated from the procedures that operate on it. This frequently leads to the use of global variables, which can be accessed and modified by any procedure in the program. While convenient, this can also lead to issues like unintended data modification and makes debugging more challenging.</li>
    <li><strong>Sequence, Selection, and Iteration:</strong> POP relies heavily on control flow mechanisms:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sequence:</strong> Instructions are executed in a linear, step-by-step order.</li>
            <li><strong>Selection (Conditional Statements):</strong> <code>if-else</code> statements and <code>switch-case</code> constructs allow different code blocks to be executed based on certain conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Iteration (Loops):</strong> <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>do-while</code> loops enable repetitive execution of code blocks.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Stateless Functions (Ideally):</strong> While not strictly enforced, ideally, procedures in POP aim to be somewhat stateless, meaning their output depends solely on their input parameters, rather than on the internal state of an object (which is an OOP concept).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> Languages like C, Pascal, and Fortran are prominent examples of procedural programming languages. Even languages with OOP features often allow and support procedural programming styles.</p>

<h5>Explanation and Comparison with OOP:</h5>

<p>The fundamental difference between POP and OOP lies in their approach to data and functions.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Data and Functions Relationship:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>In POP, data and functions are typically separate entities. Functions operate on data that may be global or passed as parameters. This separation can sometimes make it harder to manage complex data structures and their associated operations.</li>
            <li>In OOP, data and the functions that operate on that data are bundled together into objects (encapsulation). This tight coupling ensures that data is manipulated only by its authorized methods, leading to better data integrity.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Focus:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>POP focuses on "how" to do something – the sequence of steps and algorithms.</li>
            <li>OOP focuses on "what" entities are involved and how they interact – modeling real-world objects and their behaviors.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Modularity:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>In POP, modularity is achieved through functions. If a function needs to be changed, it might impact other parts of the code that call or depend on that function's behavior or shared global data.</li>
            <li>In OOP, modularity is achieved through objects. Changes within an object's internal implementation generally do not affect other objects as long as its public interface remains consistent, leading to more robust and easier-to-maintain code.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Reusability:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>In POP, code reusability is primarily achieved by calling functions from different parts of the program.</li>
            <li>In OOP, reusability is enhanced through concepts like inheritance (inheriting properties and methods from parent classes) and object instantiation (creating multiple instances of a class).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>While OOP has gained significant popularity for its advantages in managing complexity and building large-scale systems, procedural programming is still widely used, especially for smaller scripts, system-level programming, and scenarios where a linear flow of execution is more intuitive. Many modern languages combine aspects of both paradigms, allowing developers to choose the most suitable approach for different parts of a project.</p>

    <h4>7. Short Notes on Class and Object in OOPs with Real-World Example</h4>

    <h5>Class:</h5>
    <p>In Object-Oriented Programming, a <strong>class</strong> serves as a blueprint, template, or prototype from which objects are created. It defines a common structure (attributes or properties) and behavior (methods or functions) that all objects of that type will possess. A class does not occupy memory when it is defined; it's merely a logical construct. Think of a class as the design specifications for building something.</p>

    <h5>Object:</h5>
    <p>An <strong>object</strong> is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity that is created based on the specifications defined by its class. When an object is created, memory is allocated for it, and it contains actual data values for the attributes defined in its class, along with the ability to perform the behaviors (methods) specified by that class. Objects are the real-world entities that interact within a program.</p>

    <h5>Real-World Example: "Car"</h5>
    <div class="example-box">
        <p>Consider the concept of a "Car."</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Class:</strong> As a class, "Car" would define common attributes that all cars share, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Attributes (Properties):</strong> <code>color</code>, <code>make</code>, <code>model</code>, <code>year</code>, <code>engineType</code>, <code>numberOfDoors</code>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Behaviors (Methods):</strong> <code>startEngine()</code>, <code>stopEngine()</code>, <code>accelerate()</code>, <code>brake()</code>, <code>turnLeft()</code>, <code>turnRight()</code>.</li>
                </ul>
                The "Car" class is a general design that describes what a car is and what it can do.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Objects:</strong> Based on the "Car" class, you can create specific, individual car objects. For example:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Object 1 (myCar):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>color: "Red"</code></li>
                            <li><code>make: "Honda"</code></li>
                            <li><code>model: "Civic"</code></li>
                            <li><code>year: 2022</code></li>
                            <li><code>engineType: "Petrol"</code></li>
                            <li><code>numberOfDoors: 4</code></li>
                        </ul>
                        This object can <code>startEngine()</code>, <code>accelerate()</code>, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Object 2 (yourCar):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>color: "Blue"</code></li>
                            <li><code>make: "Toyota"</code></li>
                            <li><code>model: "Camry"</code></li>
                            <li><code>year: 2023</code></li>
                            <li><code>engineType: "Hybrid"</code></li>
                            <li><code>numberOfDoors: 4</code></li>
                        </ul>
                        This object also can <code>startEngine()</code>, <code>accelerate()</code>, etc.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                In this example, "Car" is the class (the blueprint), and "myCar" and "yourCar" are distinct objects (individual instances) created from that blueprint, each with its own unique set of attribute values.
            </li>
        </ul>
