            <p>
                <strong>Big Data</strong> refers to extremely large, complex, and diverse datasets that cannot be easily processed or analyzed using traditional data processing applications. These datasets are so voluminous that they require advanced and unique data management technologies and tools for efficient storage, analysis, and visualization. The primary goal of Big Data is to extract valuable insights, patterns, and trends to enable better decision-making.
            </p>
            <h3>Characteristics of Big Data (The 5 Vs):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Volume:</strong> This refers to the immense amount of data generated every second. Traditional databases cannot handle such massive scale of data, requiring new technologies for storage and processing.
                    <br><em>Example: Billions of sensor readings, petabytes of social media posts.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Velocity:</strong> This refers to the speed at which data is generated, collected, and processed. Data streams in at unprecedented speeds and must be processed quickly to be valuable.
                    <br><em>Example: Real-time stock market data, online gaming interactions, streaming video.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Variety:</strong> This signifies the diverse types of data formats. Big Data includes structured (database tables), semi-structured (XML, JSON), and unstructured data (text, images, audio, video).
                    <br><em>Example: Text from emails, images from surveillance cameras, audio from voice assistants.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Veracity:</strong> This refers to the trustworthiness, quality, and accuracy of the data. Big Data often comes from various sources, and its reliability can be inconsistent, requiring robust data cleansing and validation processes.
                    <br><em>Example: Inaccurate sensor readings, fraudulent social media posts.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Value:</strong> This is the most crucial characteristic, referring to the ability to transform raw big data into meaningful and valuable insights that can drive business decisions and innovations. Without value, the other Vs are meaningless.
                    <br><em>Example: Identifying customer purchasing patterns, predicting disease outbreaks.</em>
                </li>
