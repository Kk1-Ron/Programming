            <h2>What is System? Explain the components of system with suitable block diagram.</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>A System</strong> is a set of interacting or interdependent components working together as a unified whole to achieve a common objective or purpose. It transforms inputs into outputs through a process, often including feedback mechanisms to regulate its performance. Systems can be natural (e.g., human body) or artificial (e.g., computer system).
            </p>
            <h3>Components of a System:</h3>
            <p>A typical system consists of the following interconnected components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Input:</strong> The raw data, resources, or energy that goes into the system from its environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Process:</strong> The activities or operations that transform the input into output. This is where the work of the system takes place.</li>
                <li><strong>Output:</strong> The result of the processing activity, delivered to the environment or another system. This is the desired outcome.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Information about the system's output that is fed back to the input or process components to make necessary adjustments and improve performance. It helps in self-regulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Control:</strong> The mechanism that monitors the processes and evaluates the output against predefined goals, making adjustments based on feedback to ensure the system stays on track.</li>
                <li><strong>Boundary:</strong> Defines the scope of the system and separates it from its environment. It determines what is inside and outside the system.</li>
                <li><strong>Environment:</strong> Everything outside the system that influences it or is influenced by it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What is feasibility study? Explain different levels of feasibility study.</h2>
            <p>
                A <strong>Feasibility Study</strong> is an evaluation and analysis of the potential of a proposed project or system to determine if it is technically achievable, economically viable, operationally beneficial, and legally compliant within the given timeframe. It helps in identifying and evaluating a project's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, as well as the resources required to complete it. The primary goal is to determine if a project is worth investing in.
            </p>
            <h3>Different Levels (Types) of Feasibility Study:</h3>
            <ol>

        <!-- Why feasibility study is important Section -->
        <section>
            <h2>Why feasibility study is important in system development process? Explain.</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>feasibility study</strong> is a crucial preliminary stage in the system development process because it serves as a critical decision-making tool. It helps organizations to determine whether a proposed project is viable, achievable, and sensible before significant resources are committed.
            </p>
            <p>Here's why it is important:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Risk Reduction:</strong> It helps identify potential risks and challenges (technical, economic, operational, etc.) early in the project lifecycle. By foreseeing problems, organizations can mitigate them, avoid costly mistakes, and reduce the likelihood of project failure.</li>
                <li><strong>Informed Decision-Making:</strong> A feasibility study provides objective and comprehensive data that enables stakeholders to make informed decisions about whether to proceed with the project, revise it, or abandon it altogether. It prevents blind investment in non-viable projects.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Optimization:</strong> By assessing the required resources (financial, human, technological), it ensures that the organization has the necessary capabilities to undertake the project. This prevents misallocation of resources on projects that are beyond the organization's capacity.</li>
                <li><strong>Clarity of Objectives:</strong> The process of conducting a feasibility study often clarifies the project's objectives and scope. It forces stakeholders to think through the problem, the proposed solution, and the expected outcomes more thoroughly.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost-Benefit Analysis:</strong> It provides a clear understanding of the financial implications by weighing the estimated costs against the potential benefits. This helps in justifying the investment and ensuring a positive return on investment (ROI).</li>
                <li><strong>Stakeholder Alignment:</strong> It serves as a communication tool, bringing together various stakeholders (users, management, technical staff) to discuss and agree upon the project's parameters, fostering a shared understanding and commitment.</li>
                <li><strong>Basis for Planning:</strong> If the project is deemed feasible, the findings of the study become the foundation for detailed project planning, including scope definition, budgeting, scheduling, and resource allocation for subsequent SDLC phases.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In essence, a feasibility study acts as a gatekeeper, preventing organizations from embarking on projects that are destined to fail or are not aligned with their strategic goals, thereby saving time, money, and effort.</p>
